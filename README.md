# 🏥 Hospital Management System (Java - Data Structures Project)

This is a simple Hospital Management System built using Java, designed to simulate basic hospital operations with a focus on core data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists.

## 📦 Project Structure

This project contains Java classes that simulate key hospital operations like managing doctors, nurses, patients, medical checkups, and more — all using basic data structures.

| `Doctorlist.java`           | Linked list of doctors |
| `Nurses.java`               | Represents a nurse object |
| `patient.java`              | Represents a patient |
| `patientlist.java`          | Linked list of patients |
| `checkup.java`              | Represents a medical checkup |
| `checkupList.java`          | Linked list to manage checkup records |
| `MedicalAppliances.java`    | Represents medical appliances/equipment |
| `MedicalAppliancesList.java`| Linked list for managing appliances |
| `cleaner.java`              | Represents hospital cleaning staff |
| `stackLinkedList.java`      | Stack implementation using linked list |
| `QNode.java`                | Node for the queue implementation |
| `quene.java`                | Queue implementation (for patient or task queue management) |
